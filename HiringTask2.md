You need to create three pages:

1. Threads : This page lists all the threads created by users(a thread can be a simple note/card with title, description, date, name and other metadata.

2. New Thread: This page will contains a interface/form to create a new thread for a logged-in user.

3. Login / Register: This page will be used for login and registration. 

Your task is to create a react/other framework application with decent UI, you are allowed to be creative here and make some addition to app. 

### Task 2: 

Create a node/other server technology in order to provide data to above react/other framework application. To store data use any relational/non-relational database according to your best judgement. Create two collections/table user and threads, which will be used to store the user information and threads created by users.

1. Create API'S to fetch thread data, create a new thread and  register/login a user.

2. Store hashed password in database and the candidate can use JWT(Json web token) to handle sessions.the candidate is free to choose any other authentication methods too. 

It would be considered as a plus point if the candidate could host this app live. the candidate could use firebase, heroku or any other free hosting services.


### Judging criterion:
* UI must be decent, we understand that you are not a designer but still your taste of colors, fonts, alignments  and icons should be decent enough to create an appealing interface.The candidate can use any third party UI module such as google material design ,etc.
* For code: our primary focus will be code readability and architecture,the code should be clean and organized, i.e keep different module for diffrent functionality.
* we hihgly encourage writing test cases, though aren't mandatory for this hiring task but would definitely earn the candidate extra points.
